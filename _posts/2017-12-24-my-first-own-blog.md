Hello and welcome to my very own online diary. This is where I'm going to post my journey through learning how to code. This is also a first entry to document my introduction to dr. [Jekyl] (http://jekylrb.com) that alows me to build a meta layouts for static sites using just a Markdown markup language. Easy and sooooo ocnvenien!

Oh, here's a pdf [cheet-sheet] (http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf) of Markdown syntax for a future reference.

This blog set up based on Jekly follows tutorial from [this site]: (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

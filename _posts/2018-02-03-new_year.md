Here we go again. Second entry to the blog. Funny how silly things as missing angle bracket from opening tag "<" can change everything. Yes, I know. It's rather super newbie thing to say but... well... I missed one and wondered for two days what's wrong with date displaying on my blog posts. Re-read the tutorial couple times, checked default html layout, frustrated myself over that little silly thing and then I saw it. An enlightment. Eh.

What's the plan for this blog, or at least how I see I'm going to use it? Well, I'm going back to the era when blogs started to exsist and people mainly used them as sort of online personal diaries. So here we go:

Dear diary, today I learnt the value of checking own code for every little thing that may go missing. 

Peace and love.

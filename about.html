        <h1>JZ</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Janina [Yanina] and for quite a long time I've been a graphic designer. But then I discovered that html and css are not as scary as they seemed and I started playing with these. Java Script is a third part of the front-end holy trinity so I overcame my little axiety of it and started learning it. To my amusement it appeared to be rather nice creature and so learning is actualy a pleasant process.</p>
        <p>At the very moment I'm discoverying this whole thing called git through github mostly. Recently found out about Jekyll and now playing around with it.</p>
        <p>Plans are: I leanr enough to find an internship and once I put my foot in the door I'm in!</p>
        <p>Wish me luck.</p>
